# Storybook, Chromatic, and Playwright – Visual Testing Overview

## Storybook
Storybook is a **component development environment** and **UI documentation tool** that provides:

- **Controls & Table**: Dynamically adjust component props and inspect/edit attributes in a control panel.
- **Actions**: Capture component events and view the triggered events and parameters in real time.
- **Interactions**: Verify component behavior using interactive tests (e.g., clicking, typing).
- **Figma Integration**: Preview design specs directly in Storybook to compare designs with implementations.
- **A11y Testing**: Check components for accessibility issues.
- **Docs Support**: Automatically generate usage documentation(or you can manually wirte specific component doc `.mdx`), helping developers quickly understand and reuse shared components.
- **Custom Global Types**: Define global controls (e.g., theme switching, language selection) to manage state across all stories.

---

## Chromatic 
Chromatic is developed by the **Storybook core team** and is the **recommended visual testing tool for Storybook**.  
Its core workflow:

- Publishes the **Storybook build** (`storybook-build`) or **Chromatic archives generated by Playwright** to the cloud.
- Uses **TurboSnap** to perform **pixel-perfect diffs**, re-rendering only affected stories to speed up tests. https://www.chromatic.com/docs/turbosnap/

### Baseline https://www.chromatic.com/docs/branching-and-baselines/
- A **baseline** is the approved UI snapshot stored in Chromatic.  
- When a UI change is **approved**, that snapshot becomes the new baseline.


### UI Review
- Provides a visual **review workflow** for designers, product managers, and developers.  
- Allows team members to **comment on**, **approve**, or **reject** UI changes directly in the browser.  
- Integrates with PR status checks, blocking merges if visual changes remain unreviewed.

### UI Tests
- Automatically performs pixel-level comparisons of components in the cloud.
- Marks tests as failed when snapshots differ from baselines.
- Ensures every commit does not introduce unintended visual changes.

## Snapshot Relationships in Storybook and Playwright
The core of Chromatic’s visual testing is **snapshot diffing**.  
The snapshot relationships differ between tools:

| Tool            | Snapshot Relationship             | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Storybook**   | **1 Story ↔ 1 Snapshot**         | Each story is rendered once, and Chromatic captures a single snapshot for diffing. |
| **Playwright**  | **1 `toHaveScreenshot` ↔ 1 Snapshot** | Each call to `expect(page).toHaveScreenshot()` produces a snapshot, based on the test code. |

---

## Recommendation
- **Storybook + Chromatic**: Best for **component-level** development, design, and UI reviews.
- **Playwright + Chromatic**: Best for **end-to-end (E2E)** scenarios, real user flows, complex states and multiple browsers test.
- **Benefits of Combining Both**:
  - Chromatic performs cloud-based pixel diffs and UI reviews → no need to store snapshots locally.  
  - Centralized baseline management, commenting, and approvals

✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/angular-standalone-tutorial?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
npx nx serve storybook-project
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build storybook-project
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project storybook-project
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/angular:app demo
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/angular:lib mylib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

[Learn more about Nx plugins &raquo;](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) | [Browse the plugin registry &raquo;](https://nx.dev/plugin-registry?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Set up CI!

### Step 1

To connect to Nx Cloud, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx connect
```

Connecting to Nx Cloud ensures a [fast and scalable CI](https://nx.dev/ci/intro/why-nx-cloud?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) pipeline. It includes features such as:

- [Remote caching](https://nx.dev/ci/features/remote-cache?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/ci/features/distribute-task-execution?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Automated e2e test splitting](https://nx.dev/ci/features/split-e2e-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task flakiness detection and rerunning](https://nx.dev/ci/features/flaky-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

### Step 2

Use the following command to configure a CI workflow for your workspace:

```sh
npx nx g ci-workflow
```
